                <h2>UX Design Process</h2>
                <p>The UX/UI course I’ve just completed has been invaluable in providing both theoretical knowledge and a whole lot of practical experience in every stage of the design process. In reflecting on some of the work my classmates and I have done
                    during the course, I realised how important it is to never rush to come up with a solution without doing due diligence to the research phase. We have to keep an open mind and keep asking questions to uncover the real issues, otherwise
                    the solutions we come up with may not really help people. In a redesign project, this could result in the best/most functional parts of the original product being lost and the real problems potentially remaining unsolved.
                </p>

                <p>Here are some practices I hope to follow in future redesign projects, but many of them also apply to new products:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Begin by truly understanding the original product and underlying structure. If it’s a website, read every page (or at least at the top few levels of hierarchy if it is a big one). Learn from the stakeholders what is working and not
                        working, interview real users about what they like and dislike about the product. Conduct market research thoughtfully.</li>

                    <li> Carefully analyse the product against usability and accessibility heuristics and conduct user testing to confirm the findings of heuristic evaluations and potentially uncover other issues. Ideally do usability testing with people who
                        have disabilities to combine usability and accessibility.</li>
                    <li>Include all of the research when weighing the options of what needs to change (not just what one part of the research indicates). Research possible solutions by staying on top of how others are solving similar problems and what standards
                        are emerging.
                    </li>
                    <li>Conduct the same (or appropriately similar) usability and accessibility testing on the new design so that we can be sure it’s really solving the problems identified, ideally with real users of the product.
                    </li>
                    <li>At the end of the redesign process, apply the same standard of rigor in analysing the proposed redesign. Does it meet accessibility and usability guidelines? Is it meeting the identified needs of users? Often, time constraints and
                        scope don’t allow for all the issues to be addressed, but at least the major ones should be prioritized. Some issues may have been deprioritized because they do not affect many users, but if that issue is still a big issue for
                        a subset of users, there should at least be a plan for how that issue can be eventually addressed. Otherwise, products risk never being truly inclusive.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Inclusivity and Accessibility</h2>
                <p>I have been learning about inclusivity - including people of diverse abilities in the design and testing phases of a project. Such inclusivity results in accessible products, whereas just ticking accessibility guideline boxes doesn’t always
                    have the same effect. There are so many potential disabilities that can affect users and it is a continual work in progress to meet those needs, but I hope to further my knowledge on this topic. Already, I am questioning things like
                    the practice of using user personas as some have said they can work against inclusion - personas encourage the designer to empathize especially with a certain “target user” and their needs and this is sometimes at the expense of those
                    with unique needs. This can sometimes be necessary to avoid cope creep, but when it happens all the time, and especially for widely used products, the net effect is that people with disabilities could become further marginalized.
                </p>


                <h2>UX Deliverables</h2>

                <p>In my course, we were taught to use tools like the user persona and journey maps and I can see instances where they may be helpful, but often these just encourage superficial and simplistic thinking. We need to think deeply and critically
                    about the tools we use and even develop new tools that are more appropriate for unique situations. UX is more than a set of pretty diagrams and charts. What is essential is the process of thinking, experimenting and iterating that
                    eventually leads to good design. Even better if the whole team is in a mode of learning, is collaborative, process oriented and mutually supportive.</p>


                <h2>User Interface Design</h2>

                <p>Good interface design can be built on a solid foundation of user experience design. No amount of pretty colours and graphics can fix a poor user flow. Nevertheless, I see the power of a well-executed and attractive UI. And, it’s a process
                    I enjoy. In highschool, I studied Art and enjoyed painting. Creating high-fidelity designs in Figma and Adobe XD can sometimes give the feeling of creating art. It’s a pleasant mix of technical skill and creativity.</p>

                <h2>My Journey to design</h2>

                <p>I studied Arts and Education at the University of Western Australia. I majored in French for my Arts degree and spent a year working and studying in Paris. After graduating, I wasn’t ready to settle down yet and decided to spend more time
                    overseas. I volunteered for two years at the Baha’i World Centre in Israel working on organising correspondence. I worked with several complex customer software programmes, learned them well and soon led a team and mentored others
                    in their use. These programmes had been in use for many years and were poorly designed. I participated in a project to re-design one and I liked the role I played as a subject matter expert - I even considered becoming a business analyst.
                </p>

                <p>Later my husband and I moved to Sarajevo in Bosnia and Herzegovina where we volunteered in a community development project for children and youth for three years. After having our first child, we moved back to Australia, but moved several
                    times within Australia and even had a stint in New Zealand. We had two more kids along the way and finally settled in Adelaide, where we’ve been for the past two years.</p>

                <p>Naturally, I have been focusing on raising our three little ones, but in the last couple of years, as my youngest is getting to be a preschooler, I have been wondering about what career to pursue. My husband who is a software developer
                    encouraged me to consider design, since he saw how passionate I was back in Israel to improve the software we worked on. He also knew my attention to detail and ability to think deeply and critically analyse things would come in handy
                    in this profession. As I got into the course, it has really felt like a natural fit. I’ve enjoyed learning about the design process, about what makes a good user interface, about how to produce beautiful designs in Figma and Adobe
                    XD and most recently how to bring my designs to fruition through coding. I wish I had known about this career back when I was leaving high school, but perhaps I needed all that life experience to get to where I am now.</p>
